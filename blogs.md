Save 100K per year with the "Mark Your Data Platform"

Introduction:
Your organization is growing, you've accumulated a set of isolated data sources throughout your organization. You want your organization to become more data driven, and you feel you need to bring those sources together in way that you can derive insights that help you better manage your business. You know data engineering is critical to set up the foundation. So you are thinking of hiring a data engineer. However, hiring A senior data engineer easily costs 100K EUR per year and you are wondering if its worth the investment. 

If you ask us, the answer is no. The data engineer is not adding any value, merely laying out the foundation for your data analysts, It't these analysts who actually add the value. They perform analyses on the prepared data, helping you solve the challenges you face. So we believe you better spend that money on your data analysts instead of hiring a data engineer.

However, without a data platform, there's no data to analyse. That's where we come in. Mark Your Data Platform is a cloud-native data platform that contains everything that your analysts need. We provide the entire foundation to ingest, transform, analyze and report on your data. We help you onboard your data analysts so you can start adding value from day one.

When you were to hire a data engineer, you also risk spending over 30K€ on a "modern data stack" which combines orchestration tools like managed Airflow (e.g. cloud composer) €350 and managed data pipelines like Fivetran €1,500/month. Also, you are likely to end up with using data bases like Snowflake, Bigquery, or Redshift and might miss out on the benefits of tools like MotherDuck, which provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for data storage and analytics. As an example, when you fill in the snowflake price calculator, for only the smallest compute type, running your data platform for7 days a week 10 hours a day, you spend over 1000€ per month.
