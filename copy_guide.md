# Mark Your Data Copy Guide

This guide defines the writing style for all Mark Your Data content. Use it to maintain consistency across the website, proposals, emails, and other communications.

## Voice and Positioning

### Who We Are
Mark Your Data is a data & AI consultancy founded by Mark Schep, backed by a network of senior specialists. We position as a **founder-led firm with an expert network**, not a solo freelancer or a faceless agency.

### Core Positioning
- **Founder-led**: Mark is the visible principal and primary contact
- **Expert network**: Senior specialists join projects as needed
- **Methodology-driven**: "Make it work, make it better, make it scale" is our differentiator
- **Results-focused**: We prove value before scaling

### Target Audience
Business leaders at growing companies who want to become more data-driven but need experienced hands to make it happen.

## Writing Principles

### 1. Use "We" Consistently
Always write as a company, not an individual. This implies a team and creates professional distance.

**Do:** "We help you identify opportunities"
**Don't:** "I help you identify opportunities"

Exception: The About page and Contact page can feature Mark directly to create the founder-led authority.

### 2. Show, Don't Tell
Demonstrate qualities through specific examples rather than claiming them with adjectives.

**Do:** "We'd rather show you a working prototype in weeks than a strategy deck in months."
**Don't:** "We have a positive, pragmatic, can-do mentality."

**Do:** "That's how we've delivered results at bol.com, Heineken, Tikkie, and Winparts."
**Don't:** "We have an impressive client list."

### 3. Lead with the Methodology
Our "make it work, make it better, make it scale" approach is the differentiator. Reference it often, but naturally.

**Example:** "Our approach: make it work, make it better, make it scale."

**Example:** "Every engagement follows our methodology. Make it work: get something running fast. Make it better: refine based on real feedback. Make it scale: roll out what's proven."

### 4. Be Specific About Value
Concrete numbers and outcomes beat vague promises.

**Do:** "Save €100K per year"
**Don't:** "Significant cost savings"

**Do:** "Your analysts can start creating value immediately"
**Don't:** "Get started quickly"

### 5. Client-Centric Framing
Start with the client's situation, not our capabilities.

**Do:** "Your company has grown, and so has your data. It sits in different systems, partially used, full of potential."
**Don't:** "Mark Your Data is a leading consultancy with expertise in..."

### 6. Keep It Tight
Remove filler words. Every sentence should earn its place.

**Do:** "Figure out where data can make the biggest impact."
**Don't:** "With our proven methodologies and expertise, we help you invest in data-driven initiatives that drive business growth and maximize ROI."

## Formatting Rules

### No Em-Dashes
Never use em-dashes (—) between words. Instead:
- Split into two sentences
- Use a comma
- Restructure the phrase

**Do:** "We handle the foundation, you focus on insights."
**Don't:** "We handle the foundation—you focus on insights."

### Punctuation
- Use periods, not exclamation marks (except very sparingly in CTAs)
- Use colons to introduce lists or explanations
- Use commas for natural pauses

### Capitalization
- Sentence case for headings: "What clients say"
- Title case for service names: "Mark Your Data Platform"
- Lowercase for general terms: "data & AI", "proof of concept"

## Tone Calibration

### Professional but Human
We're experts who happen to be approachable, not friends who happen to know data.

**Do:** "Let's talk about your data"
**Don't:** "Ready to chat?"

**Do:** "We let our work speak for itself."
**Don't:** "Our clients become fans!"

### Confident but Not Arrogant
State capabilities directly without over-claiming.

**Do:** "We bring senior expertise from day one."
**Don't:** "We're the best in the industry."

**Do:** "Clients often adopt this approach for their own teams."
**Don't:** "Everyone loves our methodology."

### Direct but Not Pushy
Clear calls to action without pressure tactics.

**Do:** "Get in touch"
**Don't:** "Act now before it's too late!"

**Do:** "Book a free consultation"
**Don't:** "Limited spots available!"

## Section-Specific Guidelines

### Headlines
- Lead with value or client benefit
- Keep under 10 words when possible
- Use active voice

**Examples:**

- "Save €100K per year with the Mark Your Data Platform"
- "What clients say"

### Introductions
- Start with the client's situation or problem
- Transition to how we help
- End with a clear value statement

**Example:**
"Your company has grown, and so has your data. It sits in different systems, partially used, full of potential. You know there's value in there. The question is where to start.

We work with business leaders who want to become more data-driven but need experienced hands to make it happen."

### Service Descriptions
- One sentence on what it is
- One sentence on the outcome
- Keep under 50 words

**Example:**
"Turn your data into impact. We take projects from idea to proof of concept to production. Whether you need extra hands or end-to-end delivery, we make it happen."

### Calls to Action
