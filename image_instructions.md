On the main index, I'd like to add a way of working section which visually supports how we work.

images can be found in images/featured

## Strategy consulting
First we focus on understanding how value is created in the company
- opportunity_tree.png	-> add this to the strategy consulting detail page	
Then we look for initiatives where a small change, can have a major impact
- impact_feasibility.png	-> add this to the strategy consulting detail page	

Then we transform this into a data analytics and AI roadmap
- data_analytics_and_ai_roadmap.png	-> add this to the strategy execution index detail page	

You can executing the whole roadmap yourself, or we can help to execute parts of it, when you lack the people, the time, or the expertise.

## data platform
e.g. we can help setup the data platform
- data_analytics_and_ai_platform.png -> add a link to the platform service

## strategy execution
or we can help execute a use case end to end:
- make_it_work_make_it_better_make_it_scale -> add a link to the execution service



Now its time to add some visuals!
