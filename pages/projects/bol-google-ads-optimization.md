## Strategic Shift from Revenue to Profit Steering

For bol.com, we conducted extensive data analyses of Google Ads and internal sales & finance data. We built a compelling business case to shift from revenue-based to profit-based steering, identifying significant cost savings opportunities.

This project demonstrates how deep data analysis can drive strategic decisions that fundamentally improve business outcomes.

### The Challenge

bol.com optimized Google Ads based on revenue metrics, which didn't account for product margins. This meant they often invested heavily in advertising low-margin products. They needed a profit-based approach but required proof that the strategic shift would deliver better outcomes.
