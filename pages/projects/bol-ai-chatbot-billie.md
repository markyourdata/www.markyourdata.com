## Reducing Preventable Support Cases Through Smart Experiments

For bol.com, we initiated A/B experiments on website account pages and in 'Billie' the AI chatbot. Through systematic experimentation, we significantly reduced preventable support cases, leading to massive cost savings while improving customer experience.

This project demonstrates the power of combining AI capabilities with rigorous A/B testing to drive measurable business impact.

### The Challenge

bol.com's customer service received many preventable questions that could be resolved through better self-service options. The challenge was to identify which interventions would reduce support volume while maintaining or improving customer satisfaction.

### Our Approach

We developed a systematic experimentation framework:

- **Data Analysis** - Identified patterns in preventable support cases
- **Hypothesis Generation** - Developed interventions for account pages and chatbot
- **A/B Testing** - Rigorously tested each intervention
- **Impact Measurement** - Tracked support case reduction and customer satisfaction

By testing changes systematically, we ensured only effective interventions were deployed at scale.

### Sustainable Impact

The project delivered immediate cost savings through reduced support volume, but the lasting impact came from the methodology. We established a framework for continuously identifying and testing improvements to self-service experiences.

The A/B testing approach ensured changes actually worked before scaling them. This prevented the common mistake of deploying "improvements" that don't move the needle or worse, hurt customer experience.
