## Data-driven product decisions at tikkie

For Tikkie, we identified and quantified opportunities to improve user engagement using data & analytics. By helping teams understand where to engage and where to relax, we enabled focus on high-impact activities that meaningfully improved user experience.

This project demonstrates how analytics can guide product strategy and prioritization decisions.

### The challenge

Tikkie wanted to improve user engagement but faced countless potential opportunities. Without data-driven prioritization, they risked investing in initiatives that wouldn't meaningfully impact user behavior. They needed analytics to guide where to focus efforts.
