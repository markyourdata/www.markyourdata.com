## Building experimentation capability through coaching

For Winparts, we provided ongoing experiment guidance to help teams define, refine, and execute data-driven experiments. Through quarterly engagement, we built internal capability while delivering proven value from well-designed experiments.

This project demonstrates how expert guidance accelerates learning and improves experiment quality without taking over ownership.

### The challenge

Winparts wanted to build a culture of experimentation but lacked experience with rigorous experiment design. Teams had ideas but needed guidance on methodology, metrics, and validation approaches to ensure experiments delivered actionable insights.

### Our approach

We provided structured guidance across the experiment lifecycle:

<div>
<strong>Opportunity Finding</strong> - Help identify high-value experiment opportunities

<div>
<strong>Results Analysis</strong> - Guide interpretation and next steps

</div>
</div>

Through regular touchpoints, teams learned experiment methodology while executing real projects that proved business value.

### Building internal capability

The guidance engagement succeeded by balancing doing with teaching. We helped teams execute experiments successfully while explaining the methodology behind our recommendations. Over time, teams internalized best practices and gained confidence in their experimentation approach.

The quarterly cadence provided consistent support while giving teams space to apply learnings independently. This rhythm built capability sustainably without creating dependency on external expertise.
