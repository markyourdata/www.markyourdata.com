## Data-Driven Product Decisions at Tikkie

For Tikkie, we identified and quantified opportunities to improve user engagement using data & analytics. By helping teams understand where to engage and where to relax, we enabled focus on high-impact activities that meaningfully improved user experience.

This project demonstrates how analytics can guide product strategy and prioritization decisions.

### The Challenge

Tikkie wanted to improve user engagement but faced countless potential opportunities. Without data-driven prioritization, they risked investing in initiatives that wouldn't meaningfully impact user behavior. They needed analytics to guide where to focus efforts.

### Our Approach

We developed a systematic approach to opportunity identification:

- **User Behavior Analysis** - Deep dive into engagement patterns
- **Opportunity Quantification** - Sized impact of potential improvements
- **Prioritization Framework** - Ranked opportunities by impact and effort
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Tracked engagement metrics over time

The analysis revealed where engagement efforts would deliver the highest return and where users preferred minimal intervention.

### Strategic Value

The engagement analysis provided more than just metrics—it gave Tikkie strategic clarity on where to invest product development resources. By quantifying opportunities, we helped teams make confident decisions about what to build and, equally important, what not to build.

The "where to engage and where to relax" philosophy prevented the common mistake of over-engaging users. Sometimes the best user experience comes from staying out of the way. Data helped identify those moments.
