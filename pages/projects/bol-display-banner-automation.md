## Scaling Creative Operations Through Automation

For bol.com, we developed a web app that automated display banner creation, generating 21 banners (instead of 1) in under 30 minutes. This enabled in-sourcing the process, massively reduced costs, and increased A/B testing capacity for marketing campaigns.

This project shows how smart automation can transform creative operations from a bottleneck into a competitive advantage.

### The Challenge

bol.com relied on external agencies for display banner creation, which was slow and expensive. Each banner took significant time to produce, limiting the team's ability to run multiple A/B tests and optimize campaign performance. They needed a solution to scale creative production.

### Our Approach

We built a custom web application for automated banner generation:

- **Template System** - Flexible templates following brand guidelines
- **Batch Processing** - Generate 21 banner variations in one session
- **Quality Controls** - Automated checks for brand compliance
- **User-Friendly Interface** - Marketers can create banners without developer help

The tool enabled the marketing team to generate professional banners at scale without external dependencies.

### Transforming Creative Operations

The automation tool transformed how bol.com approached display advertising. Previously, limited by agency capacity and costs, they could only test a few creative variations. With the new tool, they could generate dozens of variations and run comprehensive A/B tests.

The in-sourcing also improved speed to market. What previously took days of back-and-forth with agencies now happened in minutes. Marketing teams gained autonomy and agility while dramatically reducing costs.
