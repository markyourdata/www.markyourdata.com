## Improving Handovers with Generative AI

For bol.com, we built and iteratively improved a GenAI-powered handover service between chatbot and human customer service agents. The project delivered improved customer experience and efficiency with minimal time investment of just 1 day per week.

This demonstrates how focused AI applications can deliver significant value without massive resource commitments.

### The Challenge

When customers needed human support after chatbot interaction, context was often lost in the handover. Customer service agents had to ask customers to repeat information, creating frustration and inefficiency. The challenge was to use AI to smooth this transition.

### Our Approach

We developed an iterative solution using generative AI:

- **Context Extraction** - AI summarizes chatbot conversation for human agents
- **Intent Classification** - Identifies customer needs for proper routing
- **Iterative Improvement** - Weekly refinement based on agent feedback
- **Integration** - Seamless connection between chatbot and human service

The 1-day-per-week investment model allowed rapid iteration while fitting within existing resource constraints.

### Efficient Innovation

The project succeeded because we focused on a specific, high-value use case and iterated quickly. The 1-day-per-week model prevented over-engineering while maintaining momentum through regular improvements based on real usage.

This approach shows how organizations can experiment with AI technologies without massive upfront investments. Start small, prove value, then expand—the same principle we apply to all data & AI initiatives.
