## Turn Your Experiment Roadmap Into Proven Value

**You have an experiment roadmap ready to execute.** We guide your teams through quarterly experiment cycles—refining, validating, executing, and evaluating—so you build experimentation capability while proving business value. You don't struggle with over-scoped experiments or poor evaluation. **Walk away with multiple validated experiments and an embedded experimentation culture.**

### Who Is This For?

This service is the **ideal follow-up to the Data & AI Offsite** for organizations ready to execute their experiment roadmap:

<div class="icon-list">
<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/map.svg" alt="Teams with roadmaps" class="icon-brand" />
<div>
<strong>Teams with experiment roadmaps</strong> - You've created a portfolio of experiments (typically from an offsite) and need guidance executing them
</div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/group.svg" alt="Building capability" class="icon-brand" />
<div>
<strong>Organizations building capability</strong> - You want expert coaching while your teams do the work, not outsourced execution
</div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/strategy.svg" alt="Committed leadership" class="icon-brand" />
<div>
<strong>Leadership committed to experimentation</strong> - You're ready to invest in quarterly experiment cycles for a full year
</div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/flask.svg" alt="Needing methodology" class="icon-brand" />
<div>
<strong>Teams needing methodology</strong> - You have ideas and resources but lack proven frameworks for experiment design and evaluation
</div>
</div>
</div>

If you want to execute an experiment roadmap while building internal experimentation capability that lasts beyond the engagement, this service is for you.

### Why Quarterly Experiment Guidance?

Having a roadmap is one thing. Executing experiments that actually prove value is another. Teams often struggle with over-scoping (experiments become too complex to deliver in one quarter), wrong metrics (measuring outputs instead of business outcomes), missing dependencies (starting before data or infrastructure is ready), and poor evaluation (unable to draw solid conclusions from results).

Quarterly guidance solves this. We help refine experiments to their simplest valuable form, validate assumptions before execution, and conduct rigorous evaluations. Over four quarters, your teams don't just complete experiments—they internalize an experimentation mindset and methodology that becomes part of your culture.

<span><strong>Poor experiment design</strong> - Teams measure outputs instead of business outcomes, making it impossible to draw solid conclusions about value</span>
</div>
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>Blocked experiments</strong> - Teams start execution before validating data availability or infrastructure readiness, causing mid-stream failures</span>
</div>
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>No learning culture</strong> - Completed experiments don't generate organizational learning because there's no structured reflection or knowledge sharing</span>
</div>
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>Inconsistent execution</strong> - Different teams approach experiments differently, making it hard to compare results or build shared methodology</span>
</div>
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>Roadmap not translating to results</strong> - You created an experiment roadmap (perhaps from an offsite) but teams struggle to execute it effectively</span>

### How We Work: Our Quarterly Cycle

Starting from your experiment roadmap (typically created in the Data & AI Offsite), we guide you through four phases each quarter:

<div class="process-steps">
<div class="process-step">
<div class="process-step-number">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/flask.svg" alt="Experiment Refinement" class="icon-brand" />
<span class="step-badge">1</span>
</div>
<div class="process-step-content">
<h4>Experiment Refinement</h4>
<p>Take the prioritized experiments from your roadmap and refine them into the simplest setup that can prove value within 3 months. We challenge teams to remove complexity and focus on core hypotheses.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="process-step">
<div class="process-step-number">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/shield-check.svg" alt="Experiment Validation" class="icon-brand" />
<span class="step-badge">2</span>
</div>
<div class="process-step-content">
<h4>Experiment Validation</h4>
<p>Before execution begins, validate that all dependencies and assumptions are in place. Is the data available? Are stakeholders aligned? Can you actually measure success? We prevent teams from starting doomed experiments.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="process-step">
<div class="process-step-number">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/rocket.svg" alt="Experiment Execution" class="icon-brand" />
<span class="step-badge">3</span>
</div>
<div class="process-step-content">
<h4>Experiment Execution</h4>
<p>Your teams execute the experiments and collect data. We provide optional monthly check-ins (1-2 hours) to unblock issues, course-correct, and share learnings across teams.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="process-step">
<div class="process-step-number">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/graph-up.svg" alt="Experiment Evaluation" class="icon-brand" />
<span class="step-badge">4</span>
</div>
<div class="process-step-content">
<h4>Experiment Evaluation</h4>
<p>Full-day quarterly session to reflect on results, share learnings across teams, discuss improvements, and plan experiments for the next quarter. This is where organizational learning happens.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

Note: While data & AI is our expertise, we help with all experiments on your roadmap—technical or non-technical. We simplify scopes, ensure the right KPIs are tracked, and help design evaluation methods so you can draw solid conclusions.

### When: Ideal Timing to Start

**Q4 or Q1 is ideal.** Most organizations start this service as a follow-up to the Data & AI Offsite, launching in Q4 or Q1 to align with annual planning cycles.

**Typical timeline:**
- 1 kickoff/initiation meeting at the start of the year to refine Q1 experiments
- 4 quarterly evaluation/planning sessions at the end of each quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Optional monthly check-ins throughout the year as needed

This cadence ensures continuous momentum while maintaining space for teams to execute.

Common trigger points:
- After Data & AI Offsite creates experiment roadmap
- Beginning of new fiscal year
- After annual planning commits to experimentation approach
- When leadership wants to build experimentation culture

</div>

<div class="content-section section-single-column">

### Where: Location Options

**Quarterly sessions** can be held at your offices, at a neutral venue, or online depending on your team's preferences and distribution.

**Preferred venue:** We have established relationships with suppliers in Utrecht City Center for in-person quarterly sessions.

**Flexibility:** Monthly check-ins are typically virtual (1-2 hour calls) for efficiency, while quarterly evaluations benefit from in-person collaboration.
