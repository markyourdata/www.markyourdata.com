### Who is this for?

This offsite is designed for **leadership teams and decision-makers** from diverse domains who want to invest strategically in data & AI:

<div class="icon-list">
<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/group.svg" alt="Cross-functional leadership" class="icon-brand" />
<div>
<strong>Cross-functional leadership</strong> - Business, technology, analytics, product, and operations leaders who need alignment
</div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/building.svg" alt="Organizations" class="icon-brand" />
<div>
<strong>Organizations moving beyond ad-hoc projects</strong> - You want to transition from scattered initiatives to a coordinated experiment portfolio
</div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/strategy.svg" alt="Strategic investment" class="icon-brand" />
<div>
<strong>Teams ready for strategic investment</strong> - Leadership is committed to data & AI and needs a clear roadmap to guide budget and priorities
</div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/calendar.svg" alt="Planning cycles" class="icon-brand" />
<div>
<strong>Planning-cycle organizations</strong> - You operate on quarterly or annual planning cycles and need a data & AI strategy that aligns
</div>
</div>
</div>

If you want to move from scattered data initiatives toward a coordinated experiment portfolio that delivers measurable business impact, this service is for you.

### Why an offsite?

Data & AI initiatives often fail because teams lack alignment. Technical teams build capabilities without clear business objectives. Business leaders have ideas but don't understand what's feasible. Projects start without proper validation criteria.

A facilitated offsite changes this dynamic. By bringing key stakeholders together in a focused environment away from daily distractions, you create shared understanding, align on priorities, and build an experiment roadmap that everyone commits to. Teams leave with clarity on what to build, how to measure success, and who does what.

### When to reach out for help

Do you recognize any of these common challenges? They're indicators that a Data & AI Offsite can help:

<div class="icon-checklist">
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>Scattered initiatives without coordination</strong> - Different teams pursue isolated data projects without alignment on strategic priorities</span>
</div>
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>Lack of stakeholder alignment</strong> - Business, technology, and data teams have conflicting views on what matters most</span>
</div>
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>Planning fatigue without action</strong> - Months of meetings and discussions don't translate into concrete experiments or measurable progress</span>
</div>
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>No clear experiment portfolio</strong> - Leadership wants to invest in data & AI but teams can't articulate which specific initiatives to pursue</span>
</div>
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>Annual planning approaching</strong> - Q4 is coming and you need a data & AI roadmap for next year's budget and priorities</span>
</div>
<div class="checklist-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/badge-check.svg" alt="Check" class="icon-small icon-accent" />
<span><strong>Too many ideas, no prioritization</strong> - Everyone has opinions on what to build but no objective framework to decide</span>
</div>
</div>

If any of these sound familiar, a Data & AI Offsite helps your leadership team create shared vision and an actionable experiment roadmap.

### How we work: our methodology

We guide you through a structured four-step process:

<div class="process-steps">
<div class="process-step">
<div class="process-step-number">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/candlestick-chart.svg" alt="Value Discovery" class="icon-brand" />
<span class="step-badge">1</span>
</div>
<div class="process-step-content">
<h4>Value Discovery</h4>
<p>Create a value tree for your organization to identify the levers where a small change would make a big impact on strategic objectives. This grounds the offsite in business value, not just technical possibilities.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="process-step">
<div class="process-step-number">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/light-bulb.svg" alt="Opportunity Discovery" class="icon-brand" />
<span class="step-badge">2</span>
</div>
<div class="process-step-content">
<h4>Opportunity Discovery</h4>
<p>Identify opportunities (data, AI, and beyond) that might move the needle on these high-leverage areas. We explore broadly to avoid prematurely narrowing to obvious solutions.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="process-step">
<div class="process-step-number">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/flask.svg" alt="Experiment Definition" class="icon-brand" />
<span class="step-badge">3</span>
</div>
<div class="process-step-content">
<h4>Experiment Definition</h4>
<p>Design small experiments that can prove value for identified opportunities within 3 months, with clear success criteria. We push teams to simplify and focus on core hypotheses.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="process-step">
<div class="process-step-number">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/map.svg" alt="Roadmap Planning" class="icon-brand" />
<span class="step-badge">4</span>
</div>
<div class="process-step-content">
<h4>Roadmap Planning</h4>
<p>Define timelines, dependencies, ownership, and priorities for your experiment portfolio. You leave with actionable quarterly plans, not vague intentions.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

Note: While data & AI is our expertise, we don't force-fit technology. The best roadmaps often include a mix of data-driven, AI-powered, and non-technical experiments.

### Outcome: your experiment roadmap

The primary deliverable is a **concrete experiment roadmap** that your team can immediately execute:

<div class="icon-list">
<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/priority-high.svg" alt="Prioritized Experiments" class="icon-accent" />
<div>
<strong>Prioritized Experiments</strong> - A portfolio of 5-15 experiments ranked by business value, feasibility, and strategic alignment
</div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/check-circle.svg" alt="Success Criteria" class="icon-accent" />
<div>
<strong>Success Criteria</strong> - Clear validation metrics for each experiment that define what "proof of value" looks like—no vague aspirations
</div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/calendar.svg" alt="Execution Plan" class="icon-accent" />
<div>
<strong>Execution Plan</strong> - Timelines (typically quarterly), dependencies, ownership, and resource requirements for each experiment
</div>
</div>

<div class="icon-list-item">
<img src="../../../assets/icons/regular/candlestick-chart.svg" alt="Value Tree" class="icon-accent" />
<div>
<strong>Value Tree</strong> - Visual map of your strategic levers and how experiments link to business impact, creating clear line of sight from execution to strategy
</div>
</div>
</div>

The roadmap sets the foundation for a full year of experimentation. By year-end, you'll have clear evidence of which initiatives to scale up and which to stop.

</div>
</div>

<div class="content-section section-single-column">

### When: ideal timing for your offsite

**Q4 is the sweet spot.** Most organizations run this offsite in Q4 as input to priorities for the following year. The ideal outcome is a commitment to run experiments throughout the full next year. By year-end, you can look back with data on which initiatives delivered value and deserve scale-up investment.

Planning ahead allows you to enter the new year with momentum rather than spending Q1 figuring out priorities.

Common trigger points:
- Q4 annual planning cycle
- New fiscal year approaching
- After strategic planning identifies data & AI as priority
- New leadership wanting to establish clear direction

</div>

<div class="content-section section-single-column">

### Where: location options

We organize offsites wherever makes sense for your team—at your offices, a retreat venue, or a neutral location that minimizes distractions.

**Preferred venue:** We have established relationships with suppliers in Utrecht City Center that provide excellent facilities for collaborative workshops.

**Your choice:** If you have a preferred location or want to combine this with a team retreat, we're flexible and will adapt to your needs.
