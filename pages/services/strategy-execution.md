# Data & AI strategy execution

Turn your data into impact. We take projects from idea to proof of concept to production. Our approach: make it work, make it better, make it scale.

---

## Who is this for?

- **Innovation teams** ready to execute on data & AI opportunities
- **Product managers** looking to validate ideas with data-driven experiments
- **Data leaders** who need to prove value before scaling investments
- **Organizations** that want to test before committing to large projects
- **Companies** looking to move from strategy to measurable results

---

## What challenges do we solve?

### Ideas without execution
You have great ideas but lack the time, skills, or resources to execute them. We bridge the gap from concept to working solution.

### Risk of large investments
Committing budget to a large project without validation is risky. Our phased approach lets you invest small, learn fast, and scale only what works.

### Slow time to value
Traditional projects take months to show results. We deliver working prototypes in weeks and proven value in months.

### Skills gap
Your team may not have the specialized skills for data science, AI, or advanced analytics. We bring senior expertise from day one.

## Our propositions

Following our methodology: **Make it work, make it better, make it scale.**

### Data exploration
**Find where small changes create big results**

We help you discover where a small change can make a big difference, and transform that opportunity into a proof of concept.

**What you get:**
- Exploratory data analysis
- Opportunity identification
- Feasibility assessment
- Quick prototype or POC

**When is this relevant?**
- You suspect there's value in your data but don't know where
- You want to explore a new use case
- You need to validate assumptions before committing resources
- You're looking for quick wins

**Typical deliverables:**
- Data exploration report
- Opportunity assessment
- Initial prototype or POC
- Recommendations for next steps

**How does a typical project look?**
1. **Kickoff (1 day)**: Align on objectives and data access
2. **Exploration (1-2 weeks)**: Data analysis, pattern discovery
3. **Prototype (1-2 weeks)**: Build initial proof of concept
4. **Review (1 day)**: Present findings and recommendations

### Proof of concept (make it work)
**Show what's possible with your data**

We develop and deploy proof of concepts that validate technical feasibility and show stakeholders what a solution looks like in practice.

**What you get:**
- Working prototype
- Technical validation
- Initial results and insights
- Feasibility report

**When is this relevant?**
- You have a specific use case to validate
- You need to prove technical feasibility
- Stakeholders need to see it working
- You're deciding between different approaches

**Typical deliverables:**
- Functional POC application or model
- Technical documentation
- Demo presentation
- Next steps recommendation

**How does a typical project look?**
1. **Planning (1 week)**: Requirements, data access, success criteria
2. **Build (3-4 weeks)**: Development, iteration, testing
3. **Demo (1 week)**: Stakeholder presentations, feedback
4. **Handoff**: Documentation, recommendations

### Proof of value (make it better)
**Prove measurable business impact**

We refine your proof of concept to prove real business value with data. Think A/B tests, controlled experiments, and hard numbers.

**What you get:**
- A/B testing or controlled experiments
- Measured business impact
- Iterative improvements
- Business case for scaling

**When is this relevant?**
- Your POC works but you need to prove ROI
- You want to optimize before scaling
- Stakeholders need business justification
- You're running experiments to find what works

**Typical deliverables:**
- Experiment results and analysis
- Quantified business impact
- Optimized solution
- Business case for production rollout

**How does a typical project look?**
1. **Experiment design (1 week)**: Define metrics, set up A/B test
2. **Execution (4-8 weeks)**: Run experiments, collect data
3. **Analysis (1-2 weeks)**: Statistical analysis, insights
4. **Optimization (2-3 weeks)**: Iterate based on learnings
5. **Business case**: ROI calculation, scaling recommendations

### Production rollout (make it scale)
**Scale what's proven across your organization**

We help you take a proven solution to production, so it delivers impact across your organization, not just in a pilot.

**What you get:**
- Production-ready solution
- Scalable infrastructure
- User adoption strategy
- Ongoing monitoring and optimization

**When is this relevant?**
- You've proven value and are ready to scale
- You need production-grade implementation
- User adoption is critical for success
- You want ongoing optimization

**Typical deliverables:**
- Production deployment
- Scalable infrastructure
- User training and documentation
- Monitoring dashboards
- Maintenance and support plan

**How does a typical project look?**
1. **Planning (2 weeks)**: Architecture, requirements, rollout plan
2. **Build (6-10 weeks)**: Production development, testing
3. **Deploy (2-3 weeks)**: Rollout, user training
4. **Optimize (4+ weeks)**: Monitor, iterate, improve
5. **Handoff**: Documentation, team enablement

## Our methodology: invest small, learn fast, scale what works

Every engagement follows our three-phase approach. Make it work: get something running fast. Make it better: refine based on real feedback. Make it scale: roll out what's proven.

This way, you only invest in solutions with proven impact.
