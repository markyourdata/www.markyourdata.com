# Data analytics & AI strategy execution

Turn data into impact. We help you transform strategic initiatives into proof of concepts, proof of values, implementation and beyond.

---

## To whom is this service relevant?

This service is ideal for:
- **Innovation teams** ready to execute on data & AI opportunities
- **Product managers** looking to validate ideas with data-driven experiments
- **Data leaders** needing to prove value before scaling investments
- **Organizations** that want to test before they invest heavily
- **Companies** seeking to move from strategy to measurable business impact

---

## What pains does this service address?

### Ideas without execution
You have great ideas but lack the time, skills, or resources to execute them. We bridge the gap from concept to working solution.

### Risk of large investments
Committing to large projects without validation is risky. Our phased approach lets you invest small, learn fast, and scale only what works.

### Slow time to value
Traditional projects take months to show results. We deliver working prototypes in weeks and proven value in months.

### Skills gap
Your team may not have the specialized skills for data science, AI, or advanced analytics. We bring the expertise to execute your vision.

## Our propositions

Following our motto: **Make it work → Make it better → Make it scale**

### Data exploration
**Discover where small changes create big impact**

We help you understand where a small change can make a big difference, and transform that opportunity into a Proof of Concept.

**What you'll get:**
- Exploratory data analysis
- Opportunity identification
- Feasibility assessment
- Quick prototype or POC

**When is this relevant?**
- You suspect there's value in your data but don't know where
- You want to explore a new use case
- You need to validate assumptions before committing resources
- You're looking for quick wins

**Typical deliverables:**
- Data exploration report
- Opportunity assessment
- Initial prototype or POC
- Recommendations for next steps

**How does a typical project look like?**
1. **Kickoff (1 day)**: Align on objectives and data access
2. **Exploration (1-2 weeks)**: Data analysis, pattern discovery
3. **Prototype (1-2 weeks)**: Build initial proof of concept
4. **Review (1 day)**: Present findings and recommendations

### Proof of concept (make it work)
**Demonstrate feasibility of your data & AI initiatives**

We develop and deploy proof of concepts that show what's possible and validate technical feasibility.

**What you'll get:**
- Working prototype
- Technical validation
- Initial results and insights
- Feasibility report

**When is this relevant?**
- You have a specific use case to validate
- You need to prove technical feasibility
- Stakeholders need to see it working
- You're deciding between different approaches

**Typical deliverables:**
- Functional POC application or model
- Technical documentation
- Demo presentation
- Next steps recommendation

**How does a typical project look like?**
1. **Planning (1 week)**: Requirements, data access, success criteria
2. **Build (3-4 weeks)**: Development, iteration, testing
3. **Demo (1 week)**: Stakeholder presentations, feedback
4. **Handoff**: Documentation, recommendations

- Measured business impact
- Iterative improvements
- Business case for scaling

**When is this relevant?**
- Your POC works but you need to prove ROI
- You want to optimize before scaling
- Stakeholders need business justification
- You're running experiments to find what works

**Typical deliverables:**
- Experiment results and analysis
- Quantified business impact
- Optimized solution
- Business case for production rollout

**How does a typical project look like?**
1. **Experiment Design (1 week)**: Define metrics, set up A/B test
2. **Execution (4-8 weeks)**: Run experiments, collect data
3. **Analysis (1-2 weeks)**: Statistical analysis, insights
4. **Optimization (2-3 weeks)**: Iterate based on learnings
5. **Business Case**: ROI calculation, scaling recommendations
