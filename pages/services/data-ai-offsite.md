### Who Is This For?

This offsite is designed for **leadership teams and decision-makers** from diverse domains—business, technology, analytics, product, operations—who want to invest strategically in data & AI. Ideal for organizations looking to move beyond ad-hoc data projects toward a coordinated experiment portfolio that delivers measurable business impact.

### Why An Offsite?

Data & AI initiatives often fail because teams lack alignment. Technical teams build capabilities without clear business objectives. Business leaders have ideas but don't understand what's feasible. Projects start without proper validation criteria.

A facilitated offsite changes this dynamic. By bringing key stakeholders together in a focused environment away from daily distractions, you create shared understanding, align on priorities, and build an experiment roadmap that everyone commits to. Teams leave with clarity on what to build, how to measure success, and who does what.

### How We Work: Our Methodology

We guide you through a structured four-step process:

**1. Value Discovery** - Create a value tree for your organization to identify the levers where a small change would make a big impact on strategic objectives.

**2. Opportunity Discovery** - Identify opportunities (data, AI, and beyond) that might move the needle on these high-leverage areas.

**3. Experiment Definition** - Design small experiments that can prove value for identified opportunities within 3 months, with clear success criteria.

**4. Roadmap Planning** - Define timelines, dependencies, ownership, and priorities for your experiment portfolio.

Note: While data & AI is our expertise, we don't force-fit technology. The best roadmaps often include a mix of data-driven, AI-powered, and non-technical experiments.

### Outcome: Your Experiment Roadmap

The primary deliverable is a **concrete experiment roadmap** that your team can immediately execute:

**Prioritized Experiments** - A portfolio of 5-15 experiments ranked by business value, feasibility, and strategic alignment

**Success Criteria** - Clear validation metrics for each experiment that define what "proof of value" looks like

**Execution Plan** - Timelines (typically quarterly), dependencies, ownership, and resource requirements for each experiment

**Value Tree** - Visual map of your strategic levers and how experiments link to business impact

The roadmap sets the foundation for a full year of experimentation. By year-end, you'll have clear evidence of which initiatives to scale up.

### When: Ideal Timing for Your Offsite

**Q4 is the sweet spot.** Most organizations run this offsite in Q4 as input to priorities for the following year. The ideal outcome is a commitment to run experiments throughout the full next year. By year-end, you can look back with data on which initiatives delivered value and deserve scale-up investment.

Planning ahead allows you to enter the new year with momentum rather than spending Q1 figuring out priorities.

### Where: Location Options

We organize offsites wherever makes sense for your team—at your offices, a retreat venue, or a neutral location that minimizes distractions.

**Preferred venue:** We have established relationships with suppliers in Utrecht City Center that provide excellent facilities for collaborative workshops.

**Your choice:** If you have a preferred location or want to combine this with a team retreat, we're flexible and will adapt to your needs.

### Practicalities: What to Expect

**Duration:** 1-2 days depending on your needs and preparation level

**Timing flexibility:** If needed, we can split the offsite across two sessions with 1-2 weeks between them

**Advance planning:** Book 2-3 months ahead to allow for venue arrangements, calendar coordination, and any pre-work

**Pre-work option:** We can conduct Value Discovery ahead of time, reducing the offsite to 1 focused day

**Participants:** Ideal group is 4-8 diverse stakeholders representing all relevant domains (business, tech, data, product, operations)

**What we provide:** Full facilitation, frameworks, materials, and documentation
