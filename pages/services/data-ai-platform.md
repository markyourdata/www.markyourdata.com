### Who Is This For?

This service is for **organizations at any stage of their data journey** who need centralized, high-quality data:

- **Starting out** - You have data scattered across systems and need one source of truth for reporting and analysis
- **Scaling up** - You've proven value with experiments and need professional infrastructure to scale
- **Building AI** - You're developing AI applications that require reliable, high-quality data pipelines

Whether you're new to data platforms or expanding existing capabilities, any serious data & AI use case requires a solid foundation.

### Why Build a Data & AI Platform?

Without a centralized data platform, organizations face constant friction:

- **Data scattered everywhere** - Teams waste time finding and combining data from multiple sources
- **Inconsistent definitions** - Different departments report conflicting numbers, eroding trust
- **Manual processes** - Hours spent on data extraction and preparation instead of analysis
- **Blocked use cases** - Advanced analytics and AI applications can't get the quality data they need

A proper data platform eliminates these bottlenecks. All data flows to one place. Quality is automated. Teams access consistent, reliable data for reporting, analytics, and AI applications. You unlock insights that were previously impossible.

### How We Build: Our Methodology

We build your data platform layer by layer, delivering a working system you can use and expand:

**1. Infrastructure** - Set up cloud infrastructure to securely run your data pipelines (AWS/Azure/GCP based on your preference)

**2. Data Pipelines** - Build the first automated pipelines to ingest data from your key databases and APIs

**3. Data Models** - Create well-structured data models that populate your data warehouse, designed for both reporting and advanced analytics

**4. Data Analytics** - Enable analytics capability on top of the warehouse so teams can start extracting value—whether through BI dashboards, analysis, or AI use cases

The result is a complete, production-ready platform that serves as the foundation for all your data and AI initiatives.

### Outcome: Your First Data Platform

Within 3 months, you'll have a working data platform that transforms how your organization uses data:

**Centralized Data** - All your key data sources flowing into one platform where it can be combined and analyzed

**New Insights Unlocked** - Discover valuable insights that were impossible when data was scattered across systems

**Foundation for Use Cases** - A reliable foundation on top of which you can build analytics dashboards, reports, and AI applications

**Self-Service Analytics** - Teams can access and analyze data independently without waiting for IT or engineering support

The platform grows with you—start with essential data sources and use cases, then expand as needs evolve.

### When: Ideal Timing to Start

**Anytime you feel you need more centralized data.** Unlike services that follow a planning cycle, platform development can start whenever you recognize the need:

- You're tired of manually combining data from multiple sources
- Teams are reporting different numbers and you need one source of truth
- You want to start building data-driven applications but lack the foundation
- Successful experiments need to scale but infrastructure is holding you back

The sooner you start, the sooner you unlock the insights and capabilities that scattered data prevents.

### Practicalities: What to Expect

**Timeline:** 3 months to first usable version that delivers immediate value

**Iterative approach:** We start with your most critical data sources and use cases, then expand incrementally based on priorities

**Knowledge transfer:** We work closely with your technical team throughout, ensuring they can maintain and evolve the platform

**Technology choices:** We align on technology stack upfront based on your existing infrastructure, team skills, and budget (AWS/Azure/GCP, specific tools and services)

**Ongoing evolution:** The platform is designed to grow—add new data sources, use cases, and capabilities as your needs develop
