# Proof of Value

## Prove Measurable Impact Before Full Investment

Don't commit millions to unproven solutions. Our Proof of Value service validates business impact with real data for under 10% of full implementation cost.

## The Challenge

Traditional data & AI projects often require significant upfront investment before proving value. This creates risk:
- **Uncertain ROI** - Will this actually deliver the promised benefits?
- **Technical Risk** - Can we build this with our data and infrastructure?
- **Organizational Risk** - Will stakeholders adopt the solution?

## Our Solution

We build focused proof-of-value projects that answer critical questions:
- Does this solution deliver measurable business impact?
- Is the technical approach viable with our data?
- What's the realistic implementation effort and timeline?
- What barriers will we face at scale?

## What We Do

### Rapid Prototyping (Weeks 1-4)
- Build working proof of concept with production data
- Implement core functionality and key algorithms
- Create basic user interface for stakeholder testing
- Establish baseline metrics and measurement framework

### Validation Testing (Weeks 5-8)
- Run pilot with real users in controlled environment
- Measure actual business impact vs. projections
- Gather user feedback and identify improvements
- Document technical learnings and challenges

### Scale Assessment (Weeks 9-10)
- Evaluate infrastructure and integration requirements
- Estimate full implementation timeline and cost
- Identify organizational change requirements
- Calculate validated ROI based on pilot results

### Go/No-Go Recommendation (Week 10)
- Present findings with data-backed recommendation
- If "Go" - deliver production roadmap and requirements
- If "No-Go" - save significant investment and pivot

## Our Three-Phase Methodology

**Make it Work** → Prove the concept is technically viable  
**Make it Better** → Validate it delivers business value  
**Make it Scale** → Define the path to production

You only invest in the next phase after proving value in the current one.

## Real Results

### Retail Enterprise
**Challenge:** Optimize inventory allocation across 200+ stores  
**PoV Investment:** $150K over 10 weeks  
**Validated Impact:** $2M annual cost savings  
**Outcome:** Full implementation approved

### Financial Services
**Challenge:** Automate fraud detection for transaction monitoring  
**PoV Investment:** $120K over 8 weeks  
**Validated Impact:** 40% reduction in false positives  
**Outcome:** Production deployment in 6 months

### Healthcare Provider
**Challenge:** Predict patient readmission risk  
**PoV Investment:** $180K over 12 weeks  
**Validated Impact:** Below expected threshold  
**Outcome:** Project cancelled, saved $2M+ on full build

## Deliverables

- **Working Prototype** - Functional solution with production data
- **Validation Report** - Measured business impact and user feedback
- **Technical Assessment** - Infrastructure, integration, and scaling requirements
- **Implementation Roadmap** - If moving forward, detailed plan and timeline
- **Go/No-Go Recommendation** - Data-backed decision framework

## Why This Matters

Proof of Value projects reduce risk by:
- Validating assumptions with real data
- Uncovering hidden challenges early
- Building stakeholder confidence through results
- Creating momentum with quick wins

## Typical Engagement

**Duration:** 10-12 weeks  
**Investment:** Fixed-fee engagement (typically $100K-$250K)  
**Team Size:** 3-5 consultants  
**Your Commitment:** Data access and 15-20 hours/week from business stakeholders

## Investment Protection

We structure engagements with clear go/no-go decision points:
- After Week 4: Technical feasibility checkpoint
- After Week 8: Business impact validation
- After Week 10: Final recommendation

If we don't prove value, you've invested far less than a full implementation.
