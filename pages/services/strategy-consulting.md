# Data & AI strategy consulting

You know there's value in your data. The question is where to invest first. We help you figure out where data & AI can make the biggest impact and turn that into a clear roadmap.

---

## Who is this for?

- **C-level executives** looking to align data & AI initiatives with business goals
- **Data & analytics leaders** who need to prioritize investments and build roadmaps
- **Innovation teams** exploring how data & AI can create new opportunities
- **Organizations** that invest in data but struggle to see results

## What challenges do we solve?

### No clear connection between data and business outcomes
Many organizations invest in data & AI without knowing which initiatives actually move the needle. We help you identify the high-impact opportunities and ignore the rest.

### Too many options, limited resources
With competing priorities and tight budgets, you can't do everything. We help you focus on the initiatives that deliver value first.

### Not sure where to start
The data & AI landscape is complex. We guide you through it with frameworks we've used at companies like bol.com, Heineken, and Winparts.
