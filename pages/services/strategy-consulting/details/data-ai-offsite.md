## Flexible to Your Needs

While the 10-day structure provides a proven framework, we adapt to fit your reality:

**Timeline:** Start any time of year—not just January. The journey works for fiscal year planning, transformation kicks-offs, or strategic reset moments.

**Team Size:** Works for leadership teams (4-8 people) or larger cross-functional groups (up to 25 participants).

**Format:** In-person offsite (recommended) or virtual workshops for distributed teams.

**Steering Frequency:** Quarterly check-ins are standard, but we can adjust to monthly or bi-monthly based on your pace of change.

**Depth:** Focus on quick wins and near-term roadmap, or go deeper into multi-year strategy and organizational change.

The core methodology stays consistent—opportunity finding, use case prioritization, roadmap creation—but the details flex to match your context, culture, and goals.

## Who This Is For

This offsite is ideal if you're:

- **Kicking off** a data & AI transformation and need alignment from day one
- **Planning annual strategy** and want your team collaboratively building the roadmap
- **Struggling with priorities** because everyone has different ideas about what matters
- **Executing already** but need regular check-ins to maintain momentum and adapt
- **Building data culture** by involving your team in strategic decisions

---

## Why This Works

**Collaborative, not top-down:** Your team builds the strategy together, creating buy-in and shared ownership.

**Structured yet flexible:** Proven frameworks guide the work, but we adapt to your specific needs.

**Action-oriented:** You leave with concrete next steps, not theoretical plans that gather dust.

**Sustained support:** Quarterly steering sessions ensure you don't lose momentum after the initial excitement.

**Practical outcomes:** Opportunity trees, prioritized use cases, and roadmaps you can actually execute.
