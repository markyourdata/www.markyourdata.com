# Strategy Consulting

<div class="opening-text">
<p>
When you lack experienced data & AI leadership, building your strategy becomes risky. We step in as your strategic partner—guiding the process, challenging assumptions, and ensuring your roadmap leads to real business impact.
</p>
<p>
You know you need a data & AI strategy. But who's going to lead it? Your team is talented, but they lack the battle scars from doing this before. The frameworks. The patterns. The pitfalls. We've built dozens of data strategies. We know what works and what doesn't. We'll either guide your team through the process as advisors, or roll up our sleeves and drive it ourselves. Either way, you get a strategy that works—not one that sits on a shelf.

## The Challenge: Experience Matters

Building a data & AI strategy isn't just about templates and frameworks. It's about:
- Knowing which questions to ask and who to ask them
- Recognizing patterns across different business models
- Understanding what's realistic given your constraints
- Balancing quick wins with long-term transformation
- Navigating organizational politics and resistance

**Without experienced leadership, even well-intentioned efforts go sideways.** Teams spend months creating beautiful strategy documents that nobody executes. Priorities shift every quarter. Initiatives fail because the foundation wasn't right.

That's where we come in.

## Who This Is For

Strategy consulting is right for you if:

- **You lack internal data & AI expertise** at the leadership level
- **You're building from scratch** and need experienced guidance
- **Previous initiatives failed** and you need fresh perspective
- **Board demands a solid strategy** before approving investment
- **You want external validation** of your approach
- **Time is critical** and you can't afford to learn by trial and error

---

## How We Work

**Collaborative, not prescriptive:** We work with your team, not instead of them. This builds internal capability while delivering results.

**Pragmatic, not theoretical:** We focus on what's achievable with your resources, culture, and constraints.

**Business-first, not tech-first:** Technology serves business outcomes, not the other way around.

**Action-oriented:** Every workshop, every document, every decision moves you toward execution.

**Flexible:** We adapt our approach to match your pace, culture, and needs.

## Which Option Is Right for You?

**Choose Intensive Sprint if:**
- You need results within 2-3 months
- You have budget for dedicated support
- No one internally has time to lead this
- You're facing a critical business deadline
- You want us to drive the entire process

**Choose Advisory Partnership if:**
- You have someone internally who can drive day-to-day

- Budget constraints favor ongoing lower-intensity support
- You want to build internal capability while getting expert guidance
- Your timeline is more flexible (6-12 months)
