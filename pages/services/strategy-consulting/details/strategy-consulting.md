## Which Pains Are Addressed?

### No Strategic Direction
You're investing in data & AI but lack a coherent strategy. We create a comprehensive plan that aligns with business objectives.

### Fragmented Initiatives
Multiple teams pursue different data projects without coordination. We create an integrated strategy that connects all initiatives.

### Unclear ROI
You're spending on data & AI but can't measure return on investment. We establish clear metrics and success criteria.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from the offsite workshop?
The offsite is a 1-2 day collaborative session for alignment and roadmap. Strategy consulting is a comprehensive multi-week engagement producing detailed documentation and implementation plans.

### Do we need to have data infrastructure already?
No. The strategy will define what infrastructure you need and when to build it. Many clients start here before building anything.

### Will you implement the strategy?
We can support implementation through our other services (Platform, Strategy Execution), or hand off to your team. Most clients want us involved in at least the first phase.

### How do you ensure the strategy gets used?
We focus on actionability: clear roadmaps, defined owners, success metrics, and change management. We also offer quarterly check-ins to keep momentum.
