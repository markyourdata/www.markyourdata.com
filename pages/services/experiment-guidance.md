### Who Is This For?

This service is the **ideal follow-up to the Data & AI Offsite**. You've created an experiment roadmap, and now you need to execute it while building internal capability. This is for organizations that want expert guidance throughout the year without outsourcing execution—your teams do the work, we provide the methodology and coaching.

### Why Quarterly Experiment Guidance?

Having a roadmap is one thing. Executing experiments that actually prove value is another. Teams often struggle with:

- **Over-scoping** - Experiments become too complex to deliver in one quarter
- **Wrong metrics** - Measuring outputs instead of business outcomes  
- **Missing dependencies** - Starting before data or infrastructure is ready
- **Poor evaluation** - Unable to draw solid conclusions from results

Quarterly guidance solves this. We help refine experiments to their simplest valuable form, validate assumptions before execution, and conduct rigorous evaluations. Over four quarters, your teams don't just complete experiments—they internalize an experimentation mindset and methodology that becomes part of your culture.

### How We Work: Our Quarterly Cycle

Starting from your experiment roadmap (typically created in the Data & AI Offsite), we guide you through four phases each quarter:

**1. Experiment Refinement** - Take the prioritized experiments from your roadmap and refine them into the simplest setup that can prove value within 3 months. Remove complexity, focus on core hypothesis.

**2. Experiment Validation** - Before execution begins, validate that all dependencies and assumptions are in place. Is the data available? Are stakeholders aligned? Can you actually measure success?

**3. Experiment Execution** - Your teams execute the experiments and collect data. We provide optional monthly check-ins (1-2 hours) to unblock issues and course-correct.

**4. Experiment Evaluation** - Full-day quarterly session to reflect on results, share learnings across teams, discuss improvements, and plan experiments for the next quarter.

Note: While data & AI is our expertise, we help with all experiments on your roadmap—technical or non-technical. We simplify scopes, ensure the right KPIs are tracked, and help design evaluation methods so you can draw solid conclusions.

### Outcome: Embedded Experimentation Culture

Over the course of a year, this service delivers both immediate results and lasting organizational improvements:

**Multiple Proof of Values** - Execute 8-16 experiments across four quarters, with several proving sufficient value to scale

**Improved Experimentation Mindset** - Teams develop a hypothesis-driven approach to problem-solving that persists beyond the engagement

**Better Experimentation Methodology** - Your organization adopts proven frameworks for experiment design, validation, and evaluation

**Stronger Experimentation Process** - Clear quarterly cadence for planning, executing, and learning from experiments becomes embedded

**Scale-up Clarity** - By year-end, you have data-backed decisions on which experiments deserve investment for scale-up next year

### When: Ideal Timing to Start

**Q4 or Q1 is ideal.** Most organizations start this service as a follow-up to the Data & AI Offsite, launching in Q4 or Q1 to align with annual planning cycles.

**Typical timeline:**
- 1 kickoff/initiation meeting at the start of the year to refine Q1 experiments
- 4 quarterly evaluation/planning sessions at the end of each quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Optional monthly check-ins throughout the year as needed

This cadence ensures continuous momentum while maintaining space for teams to execute.

### Where: Location Options

**Quarterly sessions** can be held at your offices, at a neutral venue, or online depending on your team's preferences and distribution.

**Preferred venue:** We have established relationships with suppliers in Utrecht City Center for in-person quarterly sessions.

**Flexibility:** Monthly check-ins are typically virtual (1-2 hour calls) for efficiency, while quarterly evaluations benefit from in-person collaboration.

### Practicalities: What to Expect

**Ideal follow-up:** This service is designed as the natural next step after the Data & AI Offsite, though it can also work standalone if you already have an experiment roadmap.

**Structure:**
- **1 kickoff day** - Refine and validate Q1 experiments, align on methodology
- **4 quarterly evaluation days** - Full-day sessions for reflection, learning, and planning next quarter
- **Optional monthly check-ins** - 1-2 hour calls to unblock issues and provide guidance as needed

**Your commitment:** Teams need capacity to execute 2-4 experiments per quarter. This isn't outsourced execution—your teams do the work, we provide the framework and coaching.

**Duration:** 12-month engagement aligned with your fiscal year, renewable based on results.
