## Scale Successful Experiments Across Your Organization

You've proven value with an experiment—now it's time to capture that value at scale. Our Experiment Rollout service helps you embed successful experiments into your organization, handling production infrastructure, professional code development, and user adoption to ensure experiments deliver sustained business impact.

We bridge the gap between proof of concept and production deployment, ensuring experiments transition smoothly and deliver lasting value.

### Why Rollout Makes or Breaks Value Capture

Most successful experiments never reach production. Prototype code can't handle production scale. No one considers operational requirements during experimentation. Users resist adopting new tools and processes. The result is validated experiments that never deliver business value.

Professional rollout changes this outcome. We transform validated experiments into production-grade solutions with proper infrastructure, maintainable code, and comprehensive user adoption plans. Teams capture the full value of successful experiments instead of letting them languish in the innovation graveyard.

### Our Rollout Approach

We handle the complete transition from experiment to production:

- **Production Engineering** - Refactor code for reliability, performance, and maintainability
- **Infrastructure Setup** - Deploy production infrastructure with proper monitoring and scaling  
- **Integration** - Connect with existing systems and workflows
- **User Adoption** - Train users, create documentation, and drive adoption

This comprehensive approach ensures experiments transition smoothly and deliver sustained value after initial deployment.

### Rollout Deliverables

Our rollout engagements deliver production-ready solutions:

**Production Code** - Refactored, tested, and documented code that meets enterprise standards

**Infrastructure** - Deployed, monitored, and scalable infrastructure with automated deployment

**User Enablement** - Training materials, documentation, and onboarding programs that drive adoption

**Operations Handoff** - Runbooks, monitoring dashboards, and incident response procedures

These deliverables ensure your team can maintain and evolve the solution long-term.

### Production Readiness Checklist

We ensure solutions meet enterprise requirements before rollout:

**Code Quality** - Unit tests, integration tests, code reviews, and documentation

**Scalability** - Performance testing and capacity planning

**Security** - Vulnerability scanning, access controls, and audit logging

**Observability** - Monitoring, alerting, and logging for operational visibility

This rigor ensures solutions perform reliably in production and integrate smoothly with existing operations.

## Capture the Full Value of Your Experiments

Don't let successful experiments die in proof-of-concept purgatory. Roll them out professionally and capture sustained business value.

Rollout engagements typically run 8-12 weeks depending on experiment complexity and integration requirements. We work closely with your engineering and operations teams throughout.
