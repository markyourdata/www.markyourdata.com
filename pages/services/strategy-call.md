### Who Is This For?

This free call is for **leaders and decision-makers** facing strategic questions about data & AI:

- **Executives** planning data & AI investments and unsure where to start or how to prioritize
- **Data leaders** struggling with adoption, team capabilities, or proving ROI
- **Product leaders** evaluating whether data & AI can solve specific business challenges
- **Anyone** who needs an outside perspective before making important decisions

If you're facing a data or AI challenge and want honest input from someone with real-world experience, this call is for you.

### Why a Strategy Call?

Making the wrong decisions about data & AI is expensive—not just in money, but in time, team morale, and missed opportunities. Common challenges we help clarify:

- **Unclear ROI** - You're investing but struggling to demonstrate business impact
- **Low adoption** - The technology is there but teams don't trust or use it
- **Too many options** - Everyone has ideas but you can't prioritize what will actually move the needle
- **Failed experiments** - Proof of concepts look promising but production rollouts fall flat
- **Capability gaps** - You're not sure if you have the right team, tools, or approach

An outside perspective from someone who has faced these challenges at organizations like bol.com, Heineken, and Winparts can help you avoid costly mistakes and find the path forward.

### How the Call Works

This is **not a sales call**. It's a focused conversation designed to help you think through your challenge:

**1. You Share Your Challenge** - Tell us what you're facing and what questions you're wrestling with. What keeps you up at night about data & AI?

**2. We Provide Candid Perspective** - Get honest insights based on real experience—what has worked, what has failed, and why.

**3. We Explore Options** - Discuss practical approaches you could take, based on what we've seen work in similar situations.

**4. You Ask Questions** - No question is too basic or too complex. We're here to help you think clearly.

Walk away with clarity, new ideas, and—if it makes sense for both of us—options for how we might work together.
