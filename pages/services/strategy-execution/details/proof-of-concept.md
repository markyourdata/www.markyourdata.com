# Proof of Concept (Make it Work)

<div class="opening-text">
<p>
Develop and deploy proof of concepts that demonstrate the feasibility of your data analytics and AI initiatives. Show what's possible before making major investments.
</p>
<p>
You have an idea. But is it technically possible? Leadership is skeptical. You need to see it working now. We build a working proof of concept, maybe even a proof of value in 3 months. One that demonstrates feasibility. One that shows your stakeholders what's possible. One that validates the approach before you invest big. Fast. Focused. Proven. Then you decide: refine it, scale it, or pivot.

## To Whom is This Relevant?

- **Product managers** validating new feature ideas
- **Innovation teams** testing AI/ML use cases
- **Data leaders** proving feasibility to stakeholders
- **Organizations** de-risking major investments
- **Teams** needing quick wins to build momentum

---

## When is This Relevant?

- You have a specific use case to validate
- Need to prove technical feasibility
- Stakeholders need to see it working
- Deciding between different approaches
- Building business case for larger investment
- Testing assumptions before scaling

---

## What Are Typical Deliverables of the Project?

### Working Prototype
- Functional POC application or model
- Sample data processing and outputs
- Basic user interface (if applicable)
- Demonstrated core functionality

### Technical Documentation
- Architecture and approach
- Technology choices and rationale
- Data requirements and limitations
- Known constraints and assumptions

### Demo Materials
- Presentation for stakeholders
- Demo script and scenarios
- Screenshots or videos
- Results and insights

### Recommendations
- Next steps for production
- Resource requirements
- Timeline and budget estimates
- Risk assessment

---

## How Does a Typical Project Look Like?

### Phase 1: Planning (±2 week)
- Requirements clarification
- Data access and assessment
- Define success criteria
- Technology selection

### Phase 2: Build (±4 weeks)
- Develop core functionality
- Iterate based on findings
- Testing and validation
- Prepare demo

### Phase 3: Demo & Optimzize (±4 weeks)
- Stakeholder demonstrations
- Gather feedback
- Refine approach
- Document learnings

### Phase 4: Handoff (±2 week)
- Documentation finalization
- Knowledge transfer
- Recommendations presentation
- Next steps planning

**Total Duration:** 3 months

## What We DON'T Do in a POC

To keep POCs fast and focused, we intentionally skip:
- Production-grade infrastructure
- Full security implementation
- Complete error handling
- Scalability optimization
- User training and adoption
- Integration with all systems

These come later in Proof of Value or Business Impact phases.

---

## Technology Approach

We use rapid development technologies:
- **Python** for data processing and ML
- **Jupyter notebooks** for exploration
- **Streamlit or Gradio** for quick UIs
- **DuckDB or local databases** for data
- **Open-source libraries** to move fast
- **Cloud notebooks** for ML experiments

---

## What Happens After POC?

Based on POC results, clients typically choose:

1. **Proof of Value**
   - Run A/B tests to prove business impact
   - Measure ROI before full rollout

2. **Business Impact**
   - Skip validation, go straight to production
   - When POC results are compelling enough

3. **Refinement**
   - Iterate on POC with new approach
   - Address blockers discovered

4. **Park It**
   - POC showed it's not feasible or valuable
   - Better to know now than after major investment
