# Proof of Concept (Make it Work)

<div class="opening-text">
<p>
Will the plane fly? That's the fundamental question. We build working prototypes to prove technical feasibility before investing more.
</p>
<p>

</div>


## Prerequisites

To build an effective proof of concept, it helps to have:
- **[Data Exploration →](data-exploration.html)** - Understanding of opportunities and data landscape (optional but recommended)

Don't have clarity yet? [Start with exploration](data-exploration.html).

## What Are Typical Deliverables of the Project?

<div id="services">

<div class="service-card">

### Working Prototype
- Functional POC application or model
- Basic user interface (if applicable)
- Demonstrated core functionality

</div>

<div class="service-card">

### Experiment design
- Proof of Value design

</div>

<div class="service-card">

### Next Steps
- Required resources
- Action plan


</div>

</div>


## What We DON'T Do in a POC

To keep POCs fast and focused, we intentionally skip:
- Production-grade infrastructure
- Full security implementation
- Complete error handling
- Scalability optimization
- User training and adoption
- Integration with all systems

These come later in Proof of Value or Business Impact phases.

## What Comes Next?

With a working prototype, you're ready to:
- **[Prove Business Value →](proof-of-value.html)** - Run A/B tests to measure real impact
- **[Scale to Production →](business-impact.html)** - Skip validation if results are compelling enough
