# Proof of Value (Make it Better)

<div class="opening-text">
<p>
Iterate and refine your proof of concepts to maximize impact and prove measurable business value with data. Turn technical feasibility into quantified ROI.
</p>
<p>
Your POC works. But does it deliver business value? Leadership wants proof before investing in production. You need numbers. Real ROI. We run controlled experiments in 3 months. A/B tests. Pilot programs. We measure actual business impact. We optimize performance. We build the business case for scaling. You get quantified results. Statistical proof. Clear ROI. Then you can confidently invest in full rollout.

- Prepare baseline data

### Phase 2: Development (±6 weeks)
- Develop / implement the Experiment
- 

### Phase 2: Execution (±2 weeks)
- Deploy to pilot group
- Monitor performance
- Collect data
- Initial analysis

### Phase 4: Analysis (±2 weeks)

## Experiment Methodologies

We use rigorous approaches to prove value:

### A/B Testing
- Random assignment to treatment/control
- Statistical significance testing
- Minimal disruption to business
- Clear causal relationship

### Pilot Programs
- Deploy to subset of users/locations
- Before/after comparison
- Controlled rollout
- Real-world validation

### Simulations
- Historical data analysis
- What-if scenarios
- Risk-free validation
- Fast iteration
