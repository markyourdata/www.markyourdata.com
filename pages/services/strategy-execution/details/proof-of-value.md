# Proof of Value (Make it Better)

Iterate and refine your proof of concepts to maximize impact and prove measurable business value with data. Turn technical feasibility into quantified ROI.

---

## Which Pains Are Addressed by This Service?

### Unclear Business Impact
Your POC works technically, but you need to prove it delivers business value.

### Need for ROI Justification
Leadership requires quantified business case before approving production rollout.

### Optimization Needed
The POC works but performance could be better before scaling.

### Risk of Scaling Too Early
You want to validate business value before making large infrastructure investments.

---

## To Whom is This Relevant?

- **Data leaders** needing ROI proof for budget approval
- **Product managers** running experiments to optimize features

## Why Proof of Value Matters

> "We had 10 AI ideas. Proof of Value helped us identify the 2 that actually drove business results. We scaled those and parked the rest. Saved us from wasting €500K on the wrong initiatives."  
> — Data Director, Fortune 500 Company

Most data & AI initiatives fail not because they don't work technically, but because they don't deliver business value. Proof of Value ensures you only scale what works.
