## What Happens Next?

After exploration, most clients choose one of these paths:

1. **Proof of Concept** - Build a working prototype (Make it Work)
2. **Proof of Value** - Run experiments to prove business impact (Make it Better)
3. **Platform First** - Build data infrastructure before use cases
4. **Strategic Planning** - Develop comprehensive data strategy

We'll recommend the best path based on findings.
