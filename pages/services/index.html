                    When you are new to data & AI, it makes sense to start with
                    the strategy first. Those who have the strategy, but no
                    hand's on experience, might want to start with the
                    foundations first. The more experienced organizations might
                    just need extra hands for a complex project. Whichever
                    resonates with you, we are here to help, no matter your
                    current data & AI maturity.

                            Data is scattered thoughout your organisation. It
                            takes too long to to answer simple questions and the
                            answers are inconsistent or even contradicting over
                            time. More time is spend on finding and preparing
