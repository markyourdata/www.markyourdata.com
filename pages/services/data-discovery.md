### Who Is This For?

This service is designed for **teams new to data & AI** who need guidance to get started:

- **Organizations without data expertise** - You have data but lack the skills to extract value from it
- **Teams feeling overwhelmed** - You know data could help but don't know where to start or what's possible
- **Businesses with scattered data** - You have systems collecting data but no one connecting the dots
- **Leaders seeking validation** - You want to understand what's realistic before making bigger investments

If you're at the beginning of your data journey and need a trusted guide to help you take those first steps, this service is for you.

### Why Start with Data Discovery?

Jumping directly into data projects without understanding your landscape often leads to wasted effort and disappointment. Common pitfalls we help you avoid:

- **Building the wrong thing** - Investing in solutions that don't address real business needs
- **Underestimating complexity** - Data quality issues and integration challenges derail projects
- **Missing quick wins** - Overlooking simple opportunities that could deliver value quickly
- **Team frustration** - Lack of foundational knowledge leads to confusion and resistance

Data discovery provides a safe, guided environment to learn what's possible with your data, understand limitations, and identify realistic opportunities before committing to larger initiatives.

### How We Guide Your Discovery

We work hands-on with your team for 3 month to explore your data landscape:

**1. Data Landscape Mapping** - Together, we inventory your data sources, understand what data you have, where it lives, and how it flows through your organization.

**2. Use Case Exploration** - We facilitate workshops with your team to identify business questions that data could help answer and evaluate what's feasible.

**3. Hands-On Analysis** - We work alongside your team to explore promising opportunities, demonstrating analytical techniques while building your team's skills.

**4. Experiment setup** - Based on what we discover, we help you setup an experiment to proof if the value is really there. This will help you decide wether to invest more and scale up. Or to move resources to a next discovery.

Throughout the process, we transfer knowledge so your team develops the capability to continue the data journey independently.

### Outcome: Foundation for Your Data Journey

After the discovery engagement, you'll have tangible outputs and new capabilities:

**Concrete Insights** - At least 2-3 valuable insights extracted from your data that demonstrate what's possible

**Data Landscape Understanding** - Clear documentation of what data you have, where it is, quality issues, and integration points

**Experiment setup** - An experiment to validate the discovered business value

**Team Capability** - Your team gains foundational data skills and confidence to explore further independently

**Validated Direction** - Clear understanding of whether to invest further in data, and if so, where to focus

Most importantly, you move from "we should do something with data" to "here's specifically what we can do and how."

### When: Ideal Timing to Start

**Anytime you recognize data could help but don't know where to begin.** Common trigger points:

- You're generating data through operations but not using it for decision-making
- Leadership is asking about data & AI strategy but the team lacks expertise
- You're considering hiring data talent but want to understand what's needed first
- Competitors are using data effectively and you're falling behind
- You have a hunch there are insights in your data but need help finding them

Starting with discovery before making large investments in tools, platforms, or headcount helps ensure you invest wisely.

### Practicalities: What to Expect

**Duration:** 3 months of guided discovery work

**Time commitment:** 1-2 days per week of your team's time for workshops and collaborative analysis

**Team involvement:** Works best with 3-5 people from your organization who understand the business and have access to data

**Prerequisites:** No specific data skills required—that's what we help you build. You need data (even messy data) and business questions you want to answer.

**Deliverables:** 
- Data landscape documentation
- Sample analyses demonstrating insights
- Opportunity roadmap with prioritization
- Knowledge transfer sessions

**What happens next:** Based on your discovery outcomes, teams typically choose one of these paths:

1. **New Discovery** - Your team can continue capturing value independently, so you explore a new area or use case ([Data Discovery](data-discovery.html))
2. **Data Foundation** - Lack of centralized data is blocking experiments, so you build a platform to enable future use cases ([Data & AI Platform](data-ai-platform.html))
3. **Experiment Execution** - The discovered opportunity needs implementation to prove value ([Experiment Execution](experiment-execution.html))
4. **Experiment Rollout** - Value was already proven during discovery, so you embed and scale the solution ([Experiment Rollout](experiment-rollout.html))
