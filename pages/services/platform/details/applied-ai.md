# Applied ai

<div class="opening-text">
<p>
Your house is built (infrastructure), groceries arrive automatically (pipelines), and your kitchen is organized with proven recipes (models). Now you're ready for the smart home system: AI that learns your patterns, anticipates needs, and makes intelligent decisions automatically.
</p>
<p>
But here's the reality: you can't install a smart thermostat before you have electricity. You can't have an intelligent refrigerator without a kitchen. AI needs the foundation first.
</p>
<p>
We always advise: build your data foundation first, then layer AI on top. When you're ready, we'll help you deploy AI that delivers real business value, not just impressive demos. Whether it's predictive modeling or generative AI, we turn concepts into production systems and help you execute your first use case.

## Prerequisites: foundation first

Applied AI requires the full data platform stack:
- **[Data Infrastructure →](data-infrastructure.html)** - Compute and storage for model training
- **[Data Pipelines →](data-pipelines.html)** - Fresh data feeding your AI models
- **[Data Models →](data-models.html)** - Clean, structured data for accurate predictions

**Don't have your foundation yet?** We recommend starting with infrastructure and working your way up. [Let's talk about your journey →](/pages/contact.html)


## When is this service relevant?

You should consider Applied AI when:

- You have a data platform but haven't deployed AI models
- There's a clear business use case for AI/ML
- Manual processes could be automated with AI
- You want to enhance products with intelligent features
- Your team has the data but lacks AI expertise
- You need to move from experimentation to production
