# Data Models

<div class="opening-text">
<p>
You have a house (infrastructure) and groceries delivered daily (pipelines). But raw ingredients scattered across your counter aren't useful yet. You need recipes—clear instructions that turn random ingredients into consistent, delicious meals.
</p>
<p>
Data models are your recipes. They transform raw data into organized, ready-to-use products that anyone can pick up and trust. No more confusion about which version of "revenue" to use. No more analysts spending hours figuring out how to calculate basic metrics. Just standardized data products that save time and amplify your team's effectiveness.

## Prerequisites

To create effective data models, you need:
- **[Data Infrastructure →](data-infrastructure.html)** - A platform to store and process data
- **[Data Pipelines →](data-pipelines.html)** - Automated delivery of fresh data

Don't have these yet? [Start with infrastructure](data-infrastructure.html) or [talk to us](/pages/contact.html) about the full journey.



## When is This Service Relevant?

You should consider data modeling when:

- It takes days to weeks to go from data question to answer
- Analysts spend too much time understanding raw data
- The same metric means different things to different teams
- Query performance is unacceptably slow
- You're implementing a new BI tool or data warehouse
- Data governance and lineage are concerns
- You need to democratize data access
