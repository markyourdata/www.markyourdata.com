# Data Models

Transform raw data into business insights. Design and implement data models that make your data accessible, understandable, and ready for analysis.

## Which Pains Are Addressed by This Service?

### Inconsistent Metrics
Different teams calculate the same metric differently, leading to conflicting reports. We create a single source of truth with consistent definitions.

### Complex Raw Data
Business users can't work with raw data from source systems. We transform it into intuitive, business-friendly structures.

### Slow Query Performance
Analysts wait hours for reports to run. We optimize data models for fast query performance.

### Lack of Data Understanding
Nobody knows what data means or where it comes from. We document everything and make data self-service.

## To Whom is This Service Relevant?

This service is perfect for:

- **Business intelligence teams** building reports and dashboards
- **Data analysts** struggling with complex source data
- **Organizations** with inconsistent metrics across teams
- **Companies** implementing self-service analytics
- **Teams** experiencing slow query performance

---

## When is This Service Relevant?

You should consider data modeling when:

- It takes days to weeks to go from data question to answer
- Analysts spend too much time understanding raw data
- The same metric means different things to different teams
- Query performance is unacceptably slow
- You're implementing a new BI tool or data warehouse
- Data governance and lineage are concerns
- You need to democratize data access
