# Data Infrastructure

Build a solid foundation for data-driven success. Design and implement scalable data infrastructure that supports your current needs and future growth.

---

## Which Pains Are Addressed by This Service?

### Fragmented Technology Stack
Your data lives in different systems with incompatible technologies. We create a unified, modern data stack that works together seamlessly.

### Infrastructure Can't Scale
Your current setup works for small datasets but crashes under load. We design infrastructure that grows with your business.

### Security and Compliance Concerns
You need to meet regulatory requirements while keeping data accessible. We implement proper security and governance frameworks from day one.

### Vendor Lock-in
You're stuck with expensive, proprietary solutions. We use open-source and cloud-native technologies that give you flexibility and control.

## To Whom is This Service Relevant?

This service is perfect for:

- **Startups and scale-ups** building their first data platform
- **Enterprises** modernizing legacy data infrastructure
- **Data teams** frustrated with unreliable or slow infrastructure
- **Organizations** moving to the cloud
- **Companies** preparing for AI at scale

---

## When is This Service Relevant?

You should consider data infrastructure when:

- You're starting your data & AI journey and need a solid foundation
- Your current infrastructure can't handle growing data volumes
- Data engineers spend more time maintaining infrastructure than building features
- You're experiencing frequent outages or performance issues
- You need to comply with security and governance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
- You're planning to implement AI/ML models at scale

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do we need to migrate all our data at once?
No. We typically start with a pilot data source and gradually migrate more systems. This reduces risk and allows you to learn as you go.

### Can you work with our existing cloud provider?
Yes. We're experienced with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. We'll work with your preferred platform or help you choose the best fit.

### What if our team lacks infrastructure expertise?
That's exactly why we're here. We don't just build the infrastructure - we train your team to run and maintain it. Knowledge transfer is a key part of every project.

### How do you ensure security?
Security is built in from day one, not added later. We implement encryption, access controls, audit logging, and compliance frameworks as part of the core infrastructure.
