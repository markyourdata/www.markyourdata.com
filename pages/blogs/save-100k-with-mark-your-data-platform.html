                    <h2>The data engineer dilemma</h2>
                    <p class="section-intro">
                        Your organization is growing. You've accumulated data
                        across different systems and you want to become more
                        data-driven. The natural instinct? Hire a data engineer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But at <strong>100K per year</strong>, is that really
                        the best investment?
                    </p>
                    <p>We don't think so. Here's why.</p>

                    <h2>Data engineers don't add business value</h2>
                    <p>
                        That sounds provocative, but hear us out. Data engineers
                        are essential for building and maintaining data
                        infrastructure. They set up pipelines, manage data
                        quality, and ensure data flows from A to B.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But here's the thing:
                        <strong>moving data doesn't create insights</strong>.
                        Data engineers lay the foundation, but they don't
                        directly answer business questions or drive decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's your <strong>data analysts</strong> who turn data
                        into insights. They analyze trends, build dashboards,
                        identify opportunities, and help you make better
                        decisions. That's where the real value is.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The true cost of a traditional data setup</h2>
                    <p>
                        Let's break down what a minimal data team typically
                        costs:

                    <h2>But what about customization?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A common concern: "Won't I lose flexibility without an
                        in-house data engineer?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actually, no. Our platform is built on open-source tools
                        (DLT, DBT, MotherDuck) that are fully customizable.
                        Everything is code, stored in Git, and can be modified
                        as your needs evolve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And because it's all code, modern AI tools like Claude
                        can help maintain and extend your platform. That's
                        something you can't do with SaaS configuration UIs.

                        save significantly by switching from expensive
