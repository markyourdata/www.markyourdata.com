                    <h2>The missing piece of your data stack</h2>
                    <p class="section-intro">
                        You've built the perfect cost-efficient data platform
                        with
                        <a href="./why-dlt-beats-fivetran.html"

                            >DBT for transformation</a
                        >. You're saving over €15.000/year compared to Fivetran.
                        Your pipelines run smoothly in Docker containers. But
                        there's one more piece that could revolutionize your
                        analytics: where you query that data.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The traditional warehouse problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        After saving thousands with DLT and DBT, many companies
                        default to BigQuery or Snowflake for their analytics
                        layer. These are powerful tools, but they come with
                        challenges:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-benefits">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Slow query response times</strong> -
                            Multi-second delays even for simple queries
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Dashboard loading waits</strong> - 8-15
                            seconds to load business dashboards
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Expensive at scale</strong> - Costs grow
                            with data volume and query frequency
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Over-engineered</strong> - Distributed
                            systems add complexity you may not need
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        What if there was a better way? A warehouse that's 4x
                        faster than BigQuery, costs a fraction of traditional
                        solutions, and integrates perfectly with your DLT + DBT
                        stack?
                    </p>

                    <h2>Enter motherduck: duckdb meets the cloud</h2>
                    <p class="section-intro">
                        MotherDuck extends DuckDB's lightning-fast analytical
                        engine to the cloud with collaborative features and
                        serverless infrastructure.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What makes it special?</h3>
                    <p>
                        DuckDB is an in-memory OLAP database that runs locally
                        on your machine. It's incredibly fast because it
                        leverages modern hardware efficiently - your laptop
                        today is more powerful than expensive cloud instances
                        from a few years ago. MotherDuck takes this local
                        performance and makes it collaborative and scalable.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Dual execution: best of both worlds</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here's where MotherDuck gets clever. Traditional
                        warehouses force you to choose: run everything locally
                        (fast but isolated) or run everything in the cloud
                        (collaborative but slow). MotherDuck gives you both:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-benefits">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Local processing</strong> - Leverage your
                            machine's power for speed
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Cloud scale</strong> - Access shared data
                            and run heavy workloads remotely
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Intelligent routing</strong> - Automatically
                            determines where to run each query
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Zero data movement</strong> - Query across
                            local files, S3, and MotherDuck seamlessly
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Browser-based analytics</h3>
                    <p>
                        MotherDuck can run DuckDB directly in your browser using
                        WebAssembly. This means analysts can execute complex
                        queries without server round-trips, eliminating network
                        latency entirely. It's like having a personal data
                        warehouse that runs at local speed.
                    </p>

                        truly interactive. Users explore more, find insights
                        faster, and actually enjoy working with data.

                    <p>
                        At Mark Your Data, we're obsessed with building data
                        platforms that deliver enterprise capabilities without
                        enterprise costs. We've helped companies save over
                        €20.000/year with our

                        >, and MotherDuck is the perfect addition to this stack.
                    </p>

                    <h2>A word of honesty</h2>
                    <p class="section-intro">
                        We haven't implemented MotherDuck for a customer yet.
                        But we can't wait to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We're transparent about this because we believe in
                        sharing our journey. We've tested MotherDuck
                        extensively, read the research, analyzed the benchmarks,
                        and we're convinced it's the future of cost-efficient
                        analytics. Now we're looking for the right partner to
                        implement it with.

                    <h2>Who should consider motherduck?</h2>
                    <p>MotherDuck is ideal for companies that:</p>
                    <ul class="list-benefits">
                        <li>Want to create a data warehouse from scratch.</li>
                        <li>
                            Already use (or are building) a DLT + DBT data
                            platform
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Need fast, interactive analytics for business users
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Want to reduce data warehouse costs significantly
                        </li>
                        <li>Value simplicity over complexity</li>
                        <li>
                            Have datasets from gigabytes to terabytes
                            (MotherDuck scales to TBs)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Run frequent analytical queries rather than large
                            batch processing
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>When bigquery still makes sense</h2>
                    <p>
                        To be balanced: BigQuery excels at massive-scale batch
                        processing and has deep integration with Google Cloud
                        Platform. If you're processing petabytes or need
                        GCP-native features, BigQuery might still be your best
                        choice. But for interactive analytics on
                        gigabyte-to-terabyte datasets? MotherDuck is compelling.
