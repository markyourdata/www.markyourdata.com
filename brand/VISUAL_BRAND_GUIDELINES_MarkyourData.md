# Mark your data - visual brand guidelines
## Illustrated content system

---

## 1. brand visual foundation

### Logo as primary reference
Your logo establishes the visual language for all branded content:
- **Bold, dominant use of primary colors** (#f9a800 orange, #333337 charcoal)
- **Clean geometric framing** (the charcoal square border as signature element)
- **High-impact, unmissable presence**

All illustrated content should echo this boldness and confidence. The logo is not a delicate accent—it's a statement. Your illustrated images should feel the same way.

---

## 2. color strategy for illustrated images

### Refined color rule: bold & confident
Instead of 60/30/10, use **70/20/10** for illustrated backgrounds:
- **70% Primary Color:** Orange (#f9a800) OR Charcoal (#333337)—use one dominantly
- **20% Neutral Space:** White (#FFFFFF) or Light Gray (#f4f5f5) for breathing room
- **10% Secondary Accent:** The opposite primary color, used strategically for highlights, text, or graphic elements

### Why this works
- Aligns with your logo's boldness and confidence
- Creates distinctive, instantly recognizable brand presence
- Maintains professional tone while being visually assertive
- Works across all image sizes (bold colors read well at thumbnail scale)

### Color application rules

**Orange-Primary Backgrounds:**
- Use #f9a800 as dominant background
- Illustration sits centered on orange
- Charcoal (#333337) used for: frame border, text, accent lines
- White (#FFFFFF) used for: inner border (if framing), breathing room

**Charcoal-Primary Backgrounds:**
- Use #333337 as dominant background
- Illustration sits centered on charcoal
- Orange (#f9a800) used for: frame accent, text highlights, emphasis lines
- White (#FFFFFF) used for: illustration contrast, text, borders

**Contrast & Readability:**
- Orange background + charcoal illustration = high contrast ✓
- Charcoal background + orange illustration = high contrast ✓
- Always ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
- If adding text, use charcoal on orange or orange on charcoal (never light gray on either)

## 3. framing system (the vignette strategy)

### Strategic vignette: when & how to use

**Tier 1: Featured/Premium Content — Full Logo-Style Frame**
Use the complete charcoal square frame (matching your logo proportions) on:
- Website hero images
- LinkedIn featured/promoted posts
- Service page headers
- Case study opening images
- Thought leadership content
- Email headers

**Frame Specifications:**
- Outer frame: Charcoal (#333337), 8-15% of image width
- Inner border: White (#FFFFFF), 2-3% of image width
- Illustration centered inside frame on branded background
- Creates premium, intentional, curated feeling

**Tier 2: Social Organic Posts — Subtle Accent Border**
Use a thin charcoal accent line on:
- Instagram feed posts
- Twitter/X social shares
- LinkedIn native posts (casual)
- Blog social media promos
- Pinterest pins

**Border Specifications:**
- Top border OR left-side accent bar: Charcoal (#333337), 3-5 px
- Inspired by logo geometry but not literal reproduction
- Adds visual connection without feeling heavy

**Tier 3: Authentic/Unframed — No Border**
Keep completely unframed:
- Layer 1 authentic photos (real people, unedited)
- Testimonials
- Team candid moments
- Client work in-context
- Behind-the-scenes content

**Why This Hierarchy:**
- Framed images = curated, designed, premium (gets attention)
- Accent-only images = professional, social-friendly (builds community)
- Unframed images = authentic, genuine, trustworthy (builds credibility)

---

## 4. illustration style specifications

### Visual treatment (nano banana)
Your illustrated images should maintain these characteristics:

**Line Work:**
- Fine, consistent black outlines (fineliner effect, not thick strokes)
- Simplified, clean line quality
- No photorealistic detail—simplified forms
- Professional illustration style, not cartoonish

**Color & Shading:**
- Limited color palette (4-6 colors maximum, including skin tones)
- Brand colors integrated into illustration (orange accents, charcoal shadows)
- Watercolor or wash effect for interior colors (not flat digital)
- High contrast between outlines and fills for clarity

**Subject Matter:**
- Real people (clients, team, authentic moments)
- Simplified compositions (single subject or small group, not crowded)
- Professional context or neutral backgrounds (no distracting details)
- Expressions show confidence, approachability, or positive emotion
- Diversity in representation across all images

**Sizing & Placement:**
- Illustration should occupy 50-65% of the framed/background area
- Subject should be centered or slightly off-center (intentional composition)
- Adequate white space around illustration (not cramped)
- Illustration quality maintains clarity at all sizes (test at thumbnail scale)

---

## 5. template system

### Template framework
Each template serves a specific purpose and platform. Build these as reusable Canva templates, each available in TWO color variants:
- **Variant A: Orange-Primary** (background dominant orange)
- **Variant B: Charcoal-Primary** (background dominant charcoal)

All templates are optimized for web developer specifications including file size, format, and performance standards.

**Color & Background:**
- [ ] Background uses either #f9a800 (orange) or #333337 (charcoal) as primary (70%)
- [ ] Illustration sits on branded background (not white background)
- [ ] Secondary color (#333337 or #f9a800) used as accent (max 10%)
- [ ] White space used intentionally for breathing room (20%)

**Illustration Quality:**
- [ ] Fine black outlines (fineliner effect, not thick strokes)
- [ ] Simplified, professional illustration style
- [ ] Colors limited to 4-6 total (including skin tones)
- [ ] Subject is clear, centered, and recognizable at thumbnail size
- [ ] Illustration fills 50-65% of the frame

**Framing & Positioning:**
- [ ] Correct frame type applied (Tier 1, Tier 2, or unframed)
- [ ] Frame color is #333337 (charcoal) if used
- [ ] Illustration centered with adequate white space around it
- [ ] No critical elements cropped at edges
- [ ] Composition balanced and intentional

**Typography (if included):**

## 8. production workflow

### Phase 1: source material
1. Select or shoot photograph (high resolution, good lighting, clear subject)
2. Ensure composition has breathing room around subject
3. Verify resolution (minimum 2000 px width for source)

### Phase 2: nano banana transformation
1. Upload photo to Nano Banana
2. Test 3-4 style/strength settings to find your branded look
3. Document the settings used for consistency going forward
4. Export as PNG with transparency (critical)
5. Export at 2x your template width (upscaling before downsampling preserves quality)

### Phase 3: canva template preparation
1. Open Canva template (orange variant or charcoal variant)
2. Upload Nano Banana PNG illustration to template
3. Scale illustration to fill 50-65% of frame
4. Center or position intentionally
5. Verify illustration clarity at thumbnail size
6. Add text elements if required
7. Check contrast and readability

### Phase 4: export & optimization
1. Export at template specifications (exact pixel dimensions)
2. File format: PNG for social, JPG for web (test quality)
3. File size: optimize to <500 KB for social, <300 KB for email
4. Verify export dimensions match template exactly
5. Test on mobile device before posting

### Phase 5: platform-specific publishing
1. Upload to platform (LinkedIn, Instagram, website, email)
2. Verify appearance on platform (often platforms compress/resize)
3. Test on mobile device after posting
4. Note performance metrics (engagement, click-through, shares)

---

## 9. brand guardrails

### Do
- ✓ Use bold, confident color (70/20/10 rule)
- ✓ Feature real people and authentic moments
- ✓ Apply framing strategically (not on every image)
- ✓ Maintain professional, approachable illustration style
- ✓ Test at thumbnail size before publishing
- ✓ Keep color palette consistent (#333337, #f9a800, white)
- ✓ Ensure high contrast for accessibility
- ✓ Document Nano Banana settings for consistency

### Don't
- ✗ Use pale or washed-out backgrounds
- ✗ Use stock photography or generic imagery
- ✗ Apply heavy frames to every single image (dilutes impact)
- ✗ Mix multiple illustration styles or line qualities
- ✗ Use more than 6 colors in illustration
- ✗ Compromise on illustration quality for speed
- ✗ Ignore mobile rendering (test everything small)
- ✗ Use text that's too small to read at 270x270 px
